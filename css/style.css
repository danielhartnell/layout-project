/*

Unfortunately I had some trouble building columns that would fill out
the page dynamically. I would like to investigate more but I was unable 
to make much progress this evening. 

 In testing I was able to get everything working well except 
 .column_right which would hang under .column_left. It'll be a fun
 challenge to correct that! In the meantime I have set static div 
 sizes which seems to work for now.
